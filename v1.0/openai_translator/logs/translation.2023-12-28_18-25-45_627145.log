Abstract: The liability of the carrier plays a central role in transport law of goods by
sea. The carrier's seaworthiness obligation is the most fundamental and important part
among its three basic obligations. The specific content of the carrier's seaworthiness
obligation is closely related to the interests of both the shipper and the carrier. With the
changing positions of both parties and the development of shipbuilding and navigation
technology, relevant regulations regarding the seaworthiness obligation should be
adjusted accordingly to achieve a rebalance of the interests of both parties and meet
the legislative requirements of the new maritime era. This article explores the
development issues of the carrier's seaworthiness obligation in four parts. The first part
briefly outlines the development process of the seaworthiness obligation and describes
the existing scope and content of the seaworthiness obligation under standard system
of China’s Maritime Law. The second part analyzes the provisions regarding the
carrier's seaworthiness obligation from the perspective of “Maritime Code of the People’
s Republic of China (Revision) (Exposure Draft)” (hereinafter referred to as Exposure
Draft). The third part identifies the remaining issues and loopholes in the above
provisions. Finally, the fourth part provides suggestions and prospects.

1. Introduction
As a party to international maritime cargo transportation contracts, the carrier has
the obligation to ensure the seaworthiness of the vessel. This is known as the carrier's
fundamental duty, the seaworthiness obligation. The seaworthiness obligation is an
ancient institution in maritime law, which has witnessed the evolution of shipping
economics and technology, as well as the gradual evolution of the balance of interests
and dispute resolution between shipowners and cargo owners. The development of the
seaworthiness obligation in Maritime Law signifies the constant exploration and
practice of fairness, justice, and the balance of interests, reflecting the arduous journey
of pursuing the values of maritime law.
As a major trading and shipping nation, China needs to thoroughly understand and
analyze the relevant content of the carrier's seaworthiness obligation in important
international conventions governing maritime cargo transportation, in order to achieve
sustained and stable development and ultimately become a maritime and trading

 powerhouse. At the same time, it is necessary to draw on valuable content, analyze the
deficiencies in China's regulatory framework for the seaworthiness obligation, and
propose effective suggestions based on the "People's Republic of China Maritime Law
(Draft for Solicitation of Comments)" and the latest international rules. These
suggestions aim to promote the improvement of China's regulatory framework for the
seaworthiness obligation and facilitate the stable development of maritime trade.
2. Overview of seaworthiness obligation
Since the era of navigation, the seaworthiness obligation has been recognized as one
of the fundamental obligations of the carrier and has always been a focus of attention
in maritime law. It is part of the foundation of the carrier's liability under international
maritime cargo transportation law. After the Hague Rules, the seaworthiness obligation
became known as the primary duty of the carrier [1]. The following provides a brief
overview of the development of the seaworthiness obligation and the seaworthiness
obligation under regulatory framework in the China's Maritime Law.
2.1 The development of seaworthiness obligation
2.1.1 Origin of seaworthiness obligation
The seaworthiness obligation originated during the prosperous period of European
shipping and trade. During that time, various compilations of maritime customs and
practices emerged, among which the “Oleron Customs Collection” and the “Consulate
of the Sea” were the most representative. The “Oleron Customs Collection” stipulated
the liability of the shipmaster and crew for breach of the seaworthiness obligation, while
the “Consulate of the Sea” contained provisions on the shipowner’s obligation to
properly load and protect the cargo of the cargo owner [2].
The seaworthiness obligation at that time had two notable characteristics: first, it
expanded its scope beyond just the safety of maritime navigation and began to focus on
the fitness of the vessel and crew; second, the liability of the shipper (cargo owner) was
significantly reduced, leading to the rupture of the interests of both parties. The
seaworthiness obligation for shipmasters and crew gradually became more codified,
evolving into the seaworthiness obligation in modern maritime law.
2.1.2 Early development of seaworthiness obligation
In the late 19th century, the British shipping industry flourished and became the
center of world shipping. According to the British common law at that time, liner
transportation belonged to the field of public transportation, and public carriers had to
accept any goods delivered by anyone without the right to refuse transportation. In order
to avoid this restriction, public carriers gradually began to include a large number of
exemption clauses for compensation liability in bills of lading that represented liner
transportation contracts, in order to avoid bearing compensation liability for the loss or
damage of goods. Over time, these clauses became extremely, and the abuse of
contractual freedom by carriers became widespread, seriously affecting the
development of international shipping. This situation caused dissatisfaction in

 international shipping and gradually gave rise to the movement for standardizing bills
of lading. Represented by the United States, many countries adopted various measures
of resistance, and the most representative and far-reaching impact was the Hart's Law
enacted by the United States in 1893. This law severely prohibited shipowners from
arbitrarily reducing their own responsibilities and required shipowners to guarantee the
seaworthiness for the entire duration of transportation, thereby increasing the
shipowners' responsibilities.
2.1.3 Seaworthiness obligation in the Hague Rules
The Hague Rules improved the strict and absolute seaworthiness obligation that had
long troubled carriers. It limited the time period in which carriers were liable for
seaworthiness to before and at the time of departure. As long as carriers had taken “due
diligence” measures, the “latent defects” that the vessel itself might have would not
affect the determination of whether the carriers had fulfilled their seaworthiness
obligation, and carriers would not be held liable. Under the Hague Rules, the
relationship between vessel seaworthiness and carrier exemption clauses was also
crucial. According to the rules, carriers must make the vessel seaworthy, fulfill their
seaworthiness obligation, or even if they failed to fulfill their seaworthiness obligation,
the infringement caused must not be causally related to the unseaworthiness of the
vessel in order for carriers to enjoy exemption clauses. Even if carriers fail to fulfill
their obligations of properly handling the cargo or operating on the proper route, it will
not affect the implementation of the exemption clauses. Such provisions make the
seaworthiness obligation a “primary obligation” for carriers under the Hague Rules.
However, with the birth of the Hamburg Rules and the establishment of a regime of
strict liability, this situation has changed.
2.1.4 Seaworthiness obligation in the Hague Rules
The Hamburg Rules readjusted the rights and obligations of carriers and shippers,
and made more thorough revisions to the Hague Rules, with the most important sign
being an increase in carrier liability and the establishment of a regime of strict liability
[3]. Moreover, it also modified the provisions regarding the duration of carriers’
seaworthiness obligation [4], specifically stating that carriers should bear the
seaworthiness obligation “during the period of their control of the goods”. Compared
to the Hague Rules, the seaworthiness obligation for carriers has been extended to the
entire voyage. In addition, unlike the “due diligence” requirement of the Hague Rules
and the Visby Rules, the Hamburg Rules require carriers to take “all necessary
measures that can reasonably be demanded” to avoid loss or damage to the goods. The
revised rules lengthen the duration of carriers’ seaworthiness obligation and increase
their responsibilities. Developed countries representing the interests of shipowners have
rarely signed or ratified this convention, and the convention has not truly taken effect
or had an impact.
2.1.5 Seaworthiness obligation in the Rotterdam Rules
In the Rotterdam Rules, the provisions regarding the seaworthiness obligation
explicitly state that the duration of the seaworthiness obligation includes not only the

2. 船舶适航义务概述
自航海时代以来，船舶适航义务被认为是承运人的基本义务之一，始终是海商法中的关注焦点。它是国际海洋货物运输法下承运人责任的基础之一。在海牙规则之后，船舶适航义务被称为承运人的首要义务[1]。以下简要概述了船舶适航义务的发展以及中国海商法监管框架下的船舶适航义务。

2.1 船舶适航义务的发展
2.1.1 船舶适航义务的起源
船舶适航义务起源于欧洲航运贸易的繁荣时期。在那个时候，出现了各种关于海事习俗和实践的编纂，其中《奥勒龙习俗集》和《海事领事法》最具代表性。《奥勒龙习俗集》规定了船长和船员对违反船舶适航义务的责任，而《海事领事法》则包含了关于船东对货物的适当装卸和保护义务的规定[2]。

当时的船舶适航义务具有两个显著特点：首先，它超越了海上航行的安全性，开始关注船舶和船员的适合程度；其次，货主（货物所有人）的责任显著降低，导致双方利益的破裂。船长和船员的船舶适航义务逐渐被制度化，演变为现代海商法中的船舶适航义务。

2.1.2 船舶适航义务的早期发展
19世纪末，英国航运业蓬勃发展，成为世界航运的中心。根据当时的英国普通法，班轮运输属于公共运输领域，公共承运人必须接受任何人递交的货物，无权拒绝运输。为了避免这种限制，公共承运人逐渐在代表班轮运输合同的提单中包含大量的赔偿责任豁免条款，以避免对货物的损失或损坏承担赔偿责任。随着时间的推移，这些条款变得极其普遍，并且承运人滥用契约自由的情况普遍存在，严重影响了国际航运的发展。这种情况引起了海商法领域的不满。

《海牙规则》改进了长期困扰承运人的严格和绝对的适航性义务。它将承运人对适航性的责任限制在出发前和出发时期间。只要承运人采取了“尽职调查”措施，船舶本身可能具有的“潜在缺陷”不会影响承运人是否履行了适航性义务，承运人也不会承担责任。根据《海牙规则》，船舶适航性和承运人的豁免条款之间的关系也是至关重要的。根据规则，承运人必须使船舶具备适航性，履行适航性义务，即使他们未能履行适航性义务，所造成的侵权行为也不能与船舶的非适航性有因果关系，才能享受豁免条款。即使承运人未能履行妥善处理货物或按照正确航线操作的义务，也不会影响豁免条款的实施。这些规定将适航性义务作为《海牙规则》下承运人的“主要义务”。然而，随着《汉堡规则》的诞生和严格责任制度的建立，这种情况发生了改变。

《汉堡规则》重新调整了承运人和托运人的权利和义务，并对《海牙规则》进行了更为彻底的修订，最重要的标志是承运人责任的增加和严格责任制度的建立[3]。此外，它还修改了承运人适航性义务的规定[4]，明确规定承运人应在他们对货物具有控制权期间承担适航性义务。与《海牙规则》相比，承运人的适航性义务已扩展到整个航程。此外，与《海牙规则》和《维斯比规则》所要求的“尽职调查”要求不同，汉堡规则要求承运人采取“所有可以合理要求的必要措施”来避免货物的损失或损坏。修订后的规则延长了承运人的适航性义务的持续时间，并增加了他们的责任。代表船东利益的发达国家很少签署或批准这个公约，所以该公约并没有真正生效或产生影响。

在《鹿特丹规则》中，关于适航性义务的规定明确说明适航性义务的持续时间不仅包括承运人接管货物时期，还包括运输期间。
